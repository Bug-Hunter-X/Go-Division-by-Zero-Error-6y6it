# Go Division by Zero Error

This Go program demonstrates the common error of division by zero.  The `calculate` function attempts to divide `a` by `b`, but doesn't handle the case where `b` might be zero. This leads to a runtime panic.

The solution demonstrates how to properly handle this using error handling or conditional checks.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and robust error handling in Go programs to prevent unexpected crashes.
